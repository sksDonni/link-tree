Hi everyone, 
This is Suchith Krishna S Donni, a student of 3rd year Information Science and Engineering (2019-23). In this link-tree of mine, I have tried to keep things really simple and basic. As the name of the Challenge was Roots, I thought it would be apt to think what really matters and try to maintain a minimalist theme throughout the page.
